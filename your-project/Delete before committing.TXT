Project topic:
Sneakers resell market
principal source stockx
which gets uss data on:
-Last sale price
-Lowest ask (the least anyone is willing to accpet for it)
-Highest bid (the more anyone is willing to pay for it)
-style (code for the brand)
-colorway
-retail price
-release date
-the maximum and minimum in a 52 weeks period
-the trade range in the last 12 months
-the volatility
-Hist. number of sales
-Hist. price premium over the original
-Hist average sale price

*what is my population of interest?
top rated, highest premium over og price, highest average price

*what questions can I ask about them?
by price  what charachteristics of the sneaker, brand, model 
-which brands are more common among the most expensive?
-which models ? colors?
-collaboration and with who?
 all of this can be done with more or less simple scrapping

then for the top 20(or top 10, or simply some I like) we can try and se the evolution
and get data on whether cultural events(documentaries, songs, fashion shows, political rallies are correlated with the data)
the way to get the data on cultural event will be to search for those particular models and see if the price changed or any of the other 
of these (Last sale price
-Lowest ask (the least anyone is willing to accpet for it)
-Highest bid (the more anyone is willing to pay for it)) changed 
process, plot the evolution and see if there are any spikes, if there are reaserch news related to it
(maybe twitter mentions of the designer or someone related?only last 7 days available. maybe google searches for that person)

It would be good to find a database on the number of pairs for each colorway. ASK ALI

QUeSTION block 1: Which brand is most often resold at the highest prices?
Which model?
Which colorway?

QUESTION block 2:Does the evolution of the price of selected models prices correlate with the popularity of the related figure ( designer/ collaborator) meassured in google searches?

bonus:is the volatity of the price related to the premium? aka are more hyped sneakers a riskier investment?

storytelling idea:go from the general question of which company is more hyped with the insight that most of them are collaborations, then proceed to analyse only collabs.
